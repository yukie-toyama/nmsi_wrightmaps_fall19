### <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/constructs/public/fUft37Rtk3i21xShtnnOf6gJRM4CQR" target = "_blank">1. IMR Construct Map </a>

* PDF of Construct Map, Items, and Scoring Guides is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10rKmoXhOzdaM8wFAab_11a6PFIP7HTBS" target = "_blank">here </a> 


### 2. IMR Items & Scoring Guides on BASS
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/344/bundle/388/assignments/5342/score" target = "_blank">Airline.03a </a> (L3 is the most difficult; item stem needs to be changed to prompt desired responses)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/259/item/5328/assignments/score" target = "_blank">Crude.06ab </a> (prompt should be improved to make students focus on decreasing trends)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/264/bundle/360/assignments/5741/score" target = "_blank">Cycle.04ab </a> (Scroll down to the last 2 questions; L1 & L2  not much separation)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/340/item/5769/assignments/5482/score" target = "_blank">Garden5abc </a> (Scroll down to the last 3 questions; initially 5a was too difficult as L1 and no L2 vs L3 distinction in 5bc)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/294/activities/346/item/5607/score" target = "_blank">Hiring 3ab </a> (L1, L2, L3 no separation)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/259/bundle/313/assignments/5219/score" target = "_blank">Pest.05ab </a> (scroll down to middle; L1 & L2  not much separation)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/261/bundle/356/assignments/5119/score" target = "_blank">Population.07a </a> (scroll down to the bottom)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/340/bundle/385/assignments/5482/score" target = "_blank">Powder.06a </a> (scroll down to the bottom)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/261/item/5349/assignments/score" target = "_blank">Wildlife.02_OE </a> (L1 too easy; only 2 people scored into 0)
* <a href="https://nmsi.bear-apps.com/scheduled_activities/308/activities/259/bundle/354/assignments/5219/score" target = "_blank">Word.03_MC </a> (L1 too easy; only 2 people scored into 0)

### 3a. Initial WrightMaps (from Calibration 1)

```{r plots, echo=FALSE, results = FALSE, fig.keep = 'all', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

#WrightMap1 with items on x-axis
wrightMap(theta1, thres1a, 
          label.items = itemnames,
          main.title   = "Wright Map: IMR (by item)",
          label.items.srt = 90,
          axis.items = "",
          thr.sym.col.bg = thresholds.colors)

# mean(model1$p.est$`est (d1)`)
# sd(model1$p.est$`est (d1)`)

# WrightMap 2 with thresfolds on x-axis
wrightMap(theta1, tt,
          label.items = itemnames2,
          main.title   = "Wright Map: IMR (by thresholds)",
          thr.sym.col.fg = itemcolors,
          thr.sym.col.bg = itemcolors,
          axis.items = "threshold")

```

### 3b. WrightMap after Item Investigations (from Calibration 2)

* Reduced overlap between L1 and L2 by making Garden 5a's thresfold to be L3 (initially it was misplaced at L1)
* Reduced overlap between L2 and L3 by getting rid of partial credits in Garden 5bc & Hiring3ab
* Cycle4ab has some issues with scoring guides (no separation between L1 and L2).A similar issue may exist with Pest5ab.
* The first threshold for Wild2 and Word3 (both very low) should probably be ignored as they are based on only two people scoring into 0.
